You must fix deployment systematically and stop after each step to verify with the exact commands I specify. Current deploy errors show:
	•	transformers{sys_platform=='linux'}==4.46.3 is being required, which is unsatisfiable.
	•	uv sync fails during dependency installation.
	•	Build command is broken: missing && after bash -lc.

Step 1 — Inspect and report the current config (no changes yet)
	1.	Open and print the relevant parts of:

	•	pyproject.toml (especially [project], dependencies, requires-python, and any [tool.uv] / sources/index blocks)
	•	any uv.lock / lockfile if present
	•	the deployment/build command configuration (where bash -lc cd frontend ... is defined: .replit, replit.toml, deployment settings, etc.)

Step 2 — Fix dependency markers and make requirements satisfiable
	2.	In pyproject.toml, remove any platform markers attached to transformers like:

	•	transformers; sys_platform == 'linux'
	•	or transformers{sys_platform == 'linux'}
Replace with a plain requirement:
	•	transformers==4.46.3
Do the same for any other deps with weird markers unless absolutely necessary.

	3.	Tighten Python version for deployment stability:

	•	set requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"

Step 3 — Fix uv indexes/sources
	4.	Ensure uv resolves general packages from PyPI.

	•	If there is a custom pytorch-cpu or other index set as default, remove it as default.
	•	Only allow torch-specific mapping if needed (torch can use a custom index), but transformers, accelerate, etc. must resolve from PyPI.

Step 4 — Reset lock & reinstall cleanly
	5.	Delete stale locks and caches that may preserve the bad marker:

	•	remove uv.lock (and any other lockfile produced by uv)
Then run (in this order):
	•	uv lock --python 3.11
	•	uv sync --python 3.11
If any step fails, stop and show the full error output and the exact dependency line causing it.

Step 5 — Fix the frontend build command
	6.	Replace the broken build command with a single, correctly quoted command string:

	•	bash -lc "cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build"
If there is no package-lock.json, use:
	•	bash -lc "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
Make sure the command actually runs npm run build, not only cd.

Step 6 — Final verification (must do all)
	7.	Verify locally inside Replit:

	•	python -c "import transformers; print(transformers.__version__)"
	•	python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
	•	uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT (ensure it binds and stays up)
	•	open /health and /docs successfully

Only after these checks pass, retry deployment.

Important rules:
	•	Do NOT add platform markers to transformers.
	•	Do NOT make pytorch-cpu the default index for all packages.
	•	If uv remains problematic, propose and implement the fallback: switch deployment install to pip using backend/requirements.txt and bypass uv entirely, then re-run the verification commands.

Proceed step by step and report results after each step.
